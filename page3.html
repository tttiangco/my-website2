            <p>Each rank is divided into 3 groups, for example, bronze has the 3 groups of bronze 1, 2, and 3. 3 is the
                highest and 1 is the lowest. Each rank is on a scale of 0 to 100 ranked rating and hitting either 0 or
                100 will either rank you up or down. The average rank in Valorant is Gold 2, where more than 3/4 of the
                player base resides. Radiant is the top 0.01% of a region, which contains mostly professionals and
                extremely skilled players. The lowest rank is iron 1, where less than 0.1% of the player base resides.

                fantasy themes. Each skin collection
                typically includes unique visual effects, custom animations, and sound effects, which enhances the
                player's
