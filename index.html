            Valorant is a free-to-play, 5v5, First-Person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot
            Games,
            who officially released it on June 2, 2020.
            Valorant was released at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the game's beta test ran from
            around April 7, 2020 up until the official release date.
            Valorant was an instantaneous hit in the gaming community, being a breath of fresh air to the
            first-person
            shooter scene, combining the strategic, team-based aspect of Counter Strike,
            and combining it with the unique agent abilities present in a game like Overwatch. The inspiration was
            directly taken from the most dominant FPS games at the time, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive and
            Overwatch.

        <h2>The Agents</h2>
        <p>
            Valorant has introduced a lot of loveable characters with their own unique personalities. They're referred
            to as "agents" and as of May 16, 2024, Valorant has added 24 total agents.
            Each agent has their own special abilities, some having the ability to create smokes that block off
            important lines of sight for their team to have the upper hand on the enemy, and some have an extensive kit
            of robots and gadgets at their disposal, an example being Raze who is a Brazilian explosive enthusiast who
            relies on her grenades and robot explosive to get damage, and her ultimate is a giant rocket launcher.
            There's even a robot character, named KAY/O!
