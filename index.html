            Valorant is a free-to-play, 5v5, First-Person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games,
            who officially released it on June 2, 2020.
            Valorant was released at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the game's beta test ran from
            around April 7, 2020 up until the official release date.
            Valorant was an instantaneous hit in the gaming community, being a breath of fresh air to the first-person
            shooter scene, combining the strategic, team-based aspect of Counter Strike,
            and combining it with the unique agent abilities present in a game like Overwatch. The inspiration was
            directly taken from the most dominant FPS games at the time, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive and Overwatch.
